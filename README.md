- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach that works well with Webflow's responsive tools

## Features

- Blog functionality with content collections
- Tag-based content organization
- RSS feed generation
- Dark/light theme support
- Mobile-responsive navigation
- SEO-optimized structure

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a new site in Webflow (use the HNDRX Starter Cloneable)
4. `cd my-devlink-app`
5. Connect to your Webflow project [via DevLink](https://developers.webflow.com/devlink/docs/quick-start/quick-start-component-export) (start from 2)

   1. Install the Webflow CLI: `npm install -D @webflow/webflow-cli`
   2. Authenticate with Webflow: `webflow auth login`

6. Make sure the DevLink settings in `webflow.json` are correct with the following configuration:

   ```js
   {
    "devlink":{
    "host": "https://api.webflow.com",
    "rootDir": "./devlink",
    "cssModules": true,
    "relativeHrefRoot": "/"
    }
   }
   ```

7. Prepare your Webflow components
   In your Webflow project, prepare any components you want to export to your React project by:

   - Selecting an element or group of elements
   - Right-clicking and selecting ‚ÄúCreate Component‚Äù
   - Naming your component (use clear, descriptive names)

8. Export and use your components
   1. Export your components: `webflow devlink sync`
      This will create a devlink directory in your project containing:
      - React components for each of your Webflow components
      - CSS modules for component-specific styling
      - A global CSS file for shared styles
      - A DevLinkProvider component for handling interactions
9. We added the `DevLinkProvider` element for you in the BaseLayout.astro so you can use Webflow's native interactions. Now use your components!
   Example:

   ```js
   <Navbar client:load>
     <AstroButton variant="Primary" text="Test" link={{ href: "https://www.google.com" }} slot="buttonsSlot" />
     <AstroButton variant="Secondary" text="Test" link={{ href: "https://www.google.com" }} slot="buttonsSlot" />
   </Navbar>
   ```

10. Start the development server: `npm run dev` üôå

## Webflow DevLink Integration

This template is specifically designed to work with Webflow's DevLink feature, allowing you to:

- Design your website visually in Webflow
- Export the design to this Astro project
- Maintain the connection for easy updates and iterations

The minimal styling approach ensures that Webflow's exported styles take precedence, giving you full control over the visual design while maintaining the performance benefits of Astro.
